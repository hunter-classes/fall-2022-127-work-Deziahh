Hello. My name is heroName. Last week was my birthday. We went to my NYC apartment building and had blankFood for lunch. Before this my grandmother asked me, "heroName, what do you want to eat on your birthday?" and I that is what I told her. After that we all sat in the blankRoom to open my presents. The first gift was from my sister and it was a blankNoun. 
The next gift was from my mom and it was a blankNoun. I pretended to be happy but truth is I already had one of those! 
All of a sudden, I heard a strange noise. The noise was blankAdjective and I couldn't tell where it was coming from. 
I looked around the room. I stood up and walked blankAdverb to the blankRoom. I looked in the blankNoun. 
I looked under the blankNoun. I found nothing! I realized that everyone in the other room was laughing! I asked my friend, blankName, "What is going on?" 
Everyone just laughed. I heard the noise again and I realized it was coming from one of my presents! I opened the gift and inside the box was a baby blankAnimal! What a surprise!
